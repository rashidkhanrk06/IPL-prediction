# IPL Match Outcome Predictor

This project predicts the outcome of IPL cricket matches using machine learning. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier model and provides an interactive interface through a Streamlit app.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocesses IPL match and delivery data.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict match outcomes.
- **Streamlit App**: Allows users to input match details and get predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rashidkhanrk06/IPL-prediction.git
    cd IPL-prediction
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Use the App**:
    - Enter details about the match in the Streamlit app.
    - Get predictions on the match outcome.

## Model

The model is trained on historical IPL match data to predict match outcomes based on team and match conditions.
